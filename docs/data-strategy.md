# Data Strategy

## Overview
The data strategy for the Raasid system ensures that the collected data is managed effectively, providing the foundation for AI model training, decision-making, and system optimization. The strategy focuses on data quality, security, and accessibility, enabling the system to make accurate and real-time handball detection decisions.

## Data Collection
The Raasid system collects various types of data, each playing a crucial role in the decision-making process. These data types include:

- **Video Data**: Captured from the football match, primarily for pose estimation and player tracking.
- **Sensor Data**: Collected from smart balls, tracking player interactions with the ball, including impact force and contact duration.
- **Contextual Data**: Information about the event context, including handball intent (intentional or accidental) and rule violation status.

The data is collected in real time during the match, providing a constant stream of information that is used by the AI models for decision-making.

## Data Storage
Data storage is a critical component of the Raasid system, ensuring that all data is securely stored, easily accessible, and scalable. The system uses both **local storage** for temporary data and **cloud storage** for long-term retention.

- **Local Storage**: Temporary data, such as video frames and sensor data, is stored locally on the server during the match for fast processing and decision-making.
- **Cloud Storage**: Final decisions, logs, and other non-volatile data are uploaded to cloud storage for long-term retention and analysis. This ensures that historical data is preserved for audits and further model training.

## Data Security
Ensuring the security of the data is a top priority. The Raasid system implements several measures to protect the collected data:

- **Encryption**: Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data, such as decision logs or model training datasets.
- **Data Anonymization**: Any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data is anonymized or removed to comply with privacy regulations.

## Data Quality
Data quality is crucial for ensuring that the AI models are trained and evaluated on reliable information. To maintain high data quality, the Raasid system employs the following practices:

- **Data Validation**: Data is validated before it is used for training or decision-making. This ensures that the data conforms to expected formats and ranges.
- **Error Handling**: Incomplete or corrupted data is flagged, and appropriate error handling procedures are followed to prevent erroneous model predictions.
- **Data Augmentation**: Data augmentation techniques, such as rotating or scaling images, are used to create variations in the dataset, improving the model's ability to generalize.

## Data Integration
The Raasid system integrates data from multiple sources, including video streams, sensor networks, and event context APIs. This integration is handled through a set of well-defined **APIs** that allow seamless data flow between components:

- **Pose Estimation API**: Receives video frames and returns pose estimation data, such as hand positions and limb angles.
- **Ball Contact Detection API**: Accepts sensor data and provides information about ball contact, including impact force and contact duration.
- **Event Context API**: Accepts contextual information, such as handball intent and rule violations, and returns classified decision data.

By integrating these data sources, the system ensures a comprehensive understanding of the match environment, enabling accurate decision-making.

## Data Use and Analysis
Once the data is collected, it is used for several purposes:

- **Model Training**: The collected data is used to train and fine-tune the AI models, improving their ability to detect handball incidents and make accurate decisions.
- **Decision Making**: The real-time data is processed by the system to make immediate decisions about handball incidents during the match.
- **Performance Monitoring**: The data is continuously monitored to assess the performance of the system, ensuring that it meets the expected accuracy and reliability standards.
- **Post-Match Analysis**: After the match, the collected data is analyzed to generate reports, which provide insights into decision-making and potential areas for improvement.

## Data Governance
To ensure that the data is handled in compliance with legal and ethical standards, the Raasid system follows best practices in data governance. This includes:

- **Data Provenance**: Tracking the origin and flow of data throughout the system to ensure transparency and accountability.
- **Data Retention Policies**: Defining how long different types of data will be retained based on regulatory requirements and system needs. For example, match data may be retained for several years, while temporary data may be discarded after the match.
- **Compliance**: Ensuring that the system adheres to relevant privacy regulations and standards, such as GDPR for European users.

## Future Enhancements
As the Raasid system evolves, the data strategy will continue to be refined to support new features and scale as more data is collected:

- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Future versions of the system may include more advanced real-time data processing capabilities, allowing the system to handle higher volumes of data during live matches.
- **Automated Data Labeling**: Leveraging machine learning and active learning to automate the data labeling process, reducing manual intervention and improving data quality.
- **Data Insights and Analytics**: Advanced analytics tools will be integrated into the system to provide deeper insights into match performance and decision-making, helping coaches, referees, and analysts.

## Technology Used
- **Data Collection**: Video capture devices, sensor networks for ball contact detection.
- **Data Storage**: Local servers for temporary storage, cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure) for long-term data retention.
- **Data Security**: Encryption (TLS/SSL, AES), access control mechanisms, data anonymization techniques.
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, and other data manipulation libraries for preprocessing and feature engineering.
- **APIs**: FastAPI for handling data integration and interactions between different system components.

## Getting Started
To set up the data storage and integration pipeline locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and set up the environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vseel5/raasid-project
   cd raasid-project
   python -m venv raasid-env
   raasid-env\Scripts\activate  # On macOS/Linux: source raasid-env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Start the FastAPI backend:
   ```bash
   uvicorn api.main:app --reload
   ```

3. Set up cloud storage for long-term data retention (AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage).

4. Integrate the data collection APIs (pose estimation, ball contact detection, event context) into the system.
