# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Raasid system to protect both the system’s infrastructure and user data. Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data is a core part of the system’s design. The document covers aspects of authentication, data encryption, secure coding practices, and compliance with relevant security standards.

## Security Principles

### 1. **Data Privacy**
Data privacy is fundamental to protecting user information. The system ensures that all data, including video frames, sensor data, and AI decisions, is handled securely and in accordance with privacy regulations.

- **Data Minimization**: Only the data necessary for the functioning of the system is collected and stored. Any sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) is avoided or anonymized.
- **Retention Period**: Data is only retained for as long as necessary for system operation and analytics. Once the data is no longer required, it is securely deleted.

### 2. **Encryption**
All sensitive data is encrypted, both in transit and at rest, to prevent unauthorized access.

- **In Transit**: All communication between the frontend, backend, and external systems (e.g., APIs, cloud services) is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.
- **At Rest**: Data stored in databases or cloud storage is encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
- **Encryption Keys**: Encryption keys are securely managed and rotated periodically to ensure the protection of sensitive data.

### 3. **Authentication & Authorization**
The Raasid system employs secure authentication and authorization methods to ensure that only authorized users can access the system’s resources.

- **API Authentication**: Use of **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** or **OAuth 2.0** for securing API endpoints. API requests are authenticated with tokens that are issued after a successful login.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Users are assigned roles (e.g., admin, referee) and are granted access to different parts of the system based on their role. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: For sensitive operations, such as manual VAR overrides, multi-factor authentication is required to add an extra layer of security.

### 4. **Input Validation**
To prevent injection attacks and other forms of exploitation, all user inputs are validated thoroughly.

- **Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to remove potentially dangerous characters (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- **Validation**: Ensure that all inputs follow the expected format, such as numeric values for impact force or Boolean flags for handball decisions.

### 5. **API Security**
The Raasid system uses secure methods to protect API endpoints and prevent unauthorized access.

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of API endpoints by limiting the number of requests that can be made in a given time frame. This mitigates DDoS attacks and brute force attempts.
- **API Gateway**: Use of an API gateway to manage authentication, routing, and request filtering to ensure that only authorized requests are processed.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: All API requests are logged for audit purposes. Security incidents are monitored in real-time using logging tools and threat detection systems.

### 6. **Secure Deployment**
The Raasid system is deployed in a secure environment to ensure that the infrastructure is protected from attacks.

- **Environment Isolation**: Use of isolated environments (e.g., staging and production) to ensure that testing does not impact the production environment.
- **Firewalls and Network Security**: A firewall is configured to restrict unauthorized access to critical system components. Only trusted IP addresses are allowed to connect to the backend and database servers.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: The system’s dependencies and infrastructure are regularly scanned for vulnerabilities using tools such as **OWASP Dependency-Check** and **Snyk**.

### 7. **Incident Response**
An incident response plan is in place to handle security breaches and vulnerabilities.

- **Response Plan**: In the event of a security incident, the system administrator will follow a predefined set of steps to contain and resolve the issue, including communication with stakeholders and regulatory bodies if necessary.
- **Forensics**: Logs and monitoring tools are used to investigate security breaches, identify root causes, and prevent future incidents.

### 8. **Compliance with Regulations**
The Raasid system is designed to comply with relevant data protection laws and regulations, ensuring that it adheres to security and privacy standards.

- **GDPR Compliance**: The system is designed to meet the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements for the collection, processing, and storage of personal data. This includes ensuring that data is anonymized and that users have control over their data.
- **CCPA Compliance**: The system also complies with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) to protect the privacy rights of California residents.
- **Other Regulations**: The system is designed to be flexible enough to comply with other relevant data protection and security regulations in different jurisdictions.

## Best Practices for Developers

### 1. **Secure Coding**
Developers should adhere to secure coding practices to avoid common security vulnerabilities, including:

- **Avoid hardcoded secrets**: Never store sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys) in the codebase. Use environment variables or secure secret management tools like **AWS Secrets Manager** or **HashiCorp Vault**.
- **Input Sanitization**: Always sanitize and validate user inputs before processing them.
- **Use prepared statements**: When interacting with databases, always use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.

### 2. **Regular Security Audits**
Security audits should be performed periodically to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities in the system. This includes:

- **Code Reviews**: Regular peer code reviews to ensure that security best practices are followed.
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular penetration tests to find weaknesses in the system and infrastructure.

### 3. **Secure Deployment Practices**
- **Update Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies up to date to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Automated Security Scanning**: Integrate security scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
